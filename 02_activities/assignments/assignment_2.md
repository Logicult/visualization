# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      I have used the following examples from https://public.tableau.com/app/discover to evaluate the visualisations.

        1. Good data visualisation: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adrian.zinovei/viz/SalesDashboardVer03/SALES (Sales Dashboard by Adrian Zinovei)
        - The dashboard provides a proper overview of "sales performance".  It includes metrics such as sales, quantity, profit rate etc. It also has multpile type of charts and graphs and filters. 
        
        2. Bad data visualisation : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/technical.product.marketing/viz/Salesforce-Example_10_0/OpportunityDashboard (Salesforce-Example_10.0 by Technical Product Marketing)
        - This dashboard obtains data directly from Salesforce, showing sales opportunity win rate, location, and industry.

      Your answer...

        - Good Visualisation
        1. The visualisation shows clear layout with multiple types of visualisations used so that it easy to read.
        2. Good use of color scheme - various shades of same color.
        3. Multiple chart types (bar charts, line charts etc) helps in good visual picture.
        4. Interactive elements such as filters and tooltips.
        5. Use of same design elements (colors, fonts, gridlines).
        6. Key metrics are highlighted.

        - Bad visualisation
        1. There is no clear motive of the chart. What is it trying to showcase? 
        2. The Opportunity dashboard and sales dashboard seem unrelated. There needs to be a connecting graph or metric.
        3. The 2015 and 2016 graph in Sales Dashboard - the color scheme is off.
        4. Some metrics like RUNNING TOTAL not clearly defined.
        5. Y-axis of revenue over time graph missing / not clear.
        6. "Opportunuty Max Amount" metric not clear. It go from $6m to zero in one month time. What does it show?


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...

      - Good visualisation
      1. Trend lines could make for a good summary for senior management. They are mostly interested in trends and then going into depth for thos respective data points. So this graph should be bigger than others.
      2. Notes for reference could be added to improve visualisation by giving more explanations.
      3. I personally feel the MAP is not of much use and hence can be removed. Those data points can be covered under other heads.
      4. As the data is only for 2023, no need to include year in trends.
      5. Need to include reference to previous years sales to give a better snapshot. But this would depend on data availability.
      6. Legend needs to be more prominent rather than I have to find it by pressing filter.


      - Bad Visualisation
      1. I understand there is a lot of data shown but I feel it can be simplified by limiting the number of data points covered. Remove non-essential items.
      2. Better explanation of metrics. I understand that internal employees may be aware of such words but as an outsider they are not clear.
      3. Both dash boards are unrelated in my opnion and need to be seperated. One show opportunity which is subjective and other shows actual objective performance.
      4. Critical data points can be better highlighted for ease of view by management.
      5. Revenue by Quarter graph can be improved by adding total of the year to give wholistic perspective.
      6. Sales team perfomance graph is too big without important data points like " performnce vs target" and "last year vs this year".
      7. "Opportunities by Industry" graph should be better depicted and more consistent visually. Maybe Win rates can be categorized and each industry under each category depicted instead of MOUSE OVER which is not clear.







      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
